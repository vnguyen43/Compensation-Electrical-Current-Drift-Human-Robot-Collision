Nguyen, V. and Case, J. "Compensation of Electrical Current Drift in Human-Robot Collision"
In this work, a nneural network-based controller was used to account for electrical current drift to control robot velocity in the event of human-robot collision. An experimental setup was developed where a robot joint collided with the biofidelic test device that mimicked the deformation response of the human forearm while simultaneously measuring deformation and contact force using an embedded soft force sensor. This repository contains the data from the calibration of the biofidelic sensor and the impact experiments in addition to the code to control the algorithm.

## Feedback
  This is code for running the feedback algorithm. This code also contains the raw data from the model calibrations.
  
## Data
  This is time series data for the collision experiments.
